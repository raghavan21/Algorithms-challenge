**Title:**      

    Question 1: Whoâ€™s the fastest runner?

**Language:**   
                
    Javascript

**Algorithm:**  
                        
1. Define an array of runner objects with their speed, run time, and rest time.
2. Define the duration of the race.
3. Define a function to calculate the distance a runner travels in a given duration of time.
    a. Calculate the total number of cycles the runner can complete in the duration of the race.
    b. Calculate the distance covered in full cycles.
    c. Calculate the remaining time the runner has and the distance covered in that time.
    d. Add the distance covered in the full cycles and the remaining distance to get the total distance.
    e. Return the total distance.
4. Set the winning distance to 0.
5. Loop through each runner in the array.
    a. Calculate the distance the runner travels during the race using the calculateDistance function.
    b. If the distance is greater than the current winning distance, set the winning distance to this distance.
6. Output the winning distance.

 
**Code:**     
```javascript
  const runners = [
  { name: "John", speed: 10, runTime: 6, restTime: 20 },
  { name: "James", speed: 8, runTime: 8, restTime: 25 },
  { name: "Jenna", speed: 12, runTime: 5, restTime: 16 },
  { name: "Josh", speed: 7, runTime: 7, restTime: 23 },
  { name: "Jacob", speed: 9, runTime: 4, restTime: 32 },
  { name: "Jerry", speed: 5, runTime: 9, restTime: 18 },
];

const raceDuration = 1234;

function calculateDistance(runner, duration) {
  const cycleTime = runner.runTime + runner.restTime;
  const cycles = Math.floor(duration / cycleTime);
  const remainingTime = duration % cycleTime;
  const runDuration = Math.min(remainingTime, runner.runTime);
  const distance = (cycles * runner.speed * runner.runTime) + (runner.speed * runDuration);
  return distance;
}

let winningDistance = 0;

for (const runner of runners) {
  const distance = calculateDistance(runner, raceDuration);
  if (distance > winningDistance) {
    winningDistance = distance;
  }
}

console.log("The winning distance is " + winningDistance + " meters.");      
 ```
 
 **Solution:** 
 
   The winning distance is 3540 metres.
