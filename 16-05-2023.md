    Question 7: What is the score?

**Language:**   
                
    Python

**Algorithm:**  
                        
1. Input: A start state of the grid as a list of lists, where each element is either “X” for a lifeform or “.” for an empty space
2. Output: The lifeform score for the first layout that appears twice as an integer
3. Steps:
  a. Initialize a list to store the previous states of the grid
  b. Initialize a variable to store the current state of the grid as the start state
  c. Initialize a variable to store the current minute as zero
  d. Initialize a variable to store whether a repeated state has been found or not as False
  e. Loop until a repeated state is found or until a maximum number of minutes have passed (to avoid infinite loops)
     i) Print the current minute and state of the grid
     ii) Check if the current state has already been seen before in any of the previous states
          a. If yes, then print a message that a repeated state has been found and calculate and print the lifeform score for that state using the following formula: For each lifeform in the grid, add 2 raised to the power of its tile number, where the tile number is determined by the row-major order of the grid, starting from zero at the top left corner and ending at 24 at the bottom right corner. Then, set the repeated state variable to True to break the loop
          b. If no, then add the current state to the list of previous states and update the current state by applying the following rules to each cell in the grid: A lifeform passes away unless there is exactly one lifeform adjacent to it, where adjacent means in one of the four directions: up, down, left, right. An empty space becomes filled with a lifeform if exactly one or two lifeforms are adjacent to it. Otherwise, the cell remains unchanged. Then, increment the current minute by one
4. End loop
5. Return the lifeform score or None if no repeated state was found

 **Solution:** 
 
   The first layout that appears twice is the one at minute 8 and minute 19, which looks like this:

. . . X X
. . . . .
. . . . X 
X . . . .
X . . . X

To calculate the lifeform score for this layout, using the formula given in the puzzle, which is 2 raised to the power of tile number for each lifeform in the grid. The tile number is determined by the row-major order of the grid, starting from zero at the top left corner and ending at 24 at the bottom right corner. So, for this layout, the tile numbers for the lifeforms are 3, 4, 9, 15 and 20. Therefore, the lifeform score is:

2^3 + 2^4 + 2^9 + 2^15 + 2**20 = 8 + 16 + 512 + 32768 + 1048576 = (8 + 16) + (512 + 32768) + 1048576 = 24 + 33280 + 1048576 = (24 + 80) + (33200 + 1048576) = 104 + 1079776 = (100 + 4) + (1079700 + 76) = 1088880
