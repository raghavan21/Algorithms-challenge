    Question 4: Find the minimum cost of based on the array

**Language:**   
                
    Python

**Algorithm:**  
                        
  1. The array is sorted in ascending order to exlude the last element (997).
  2. Adjacent elements are paired and the corresponding cost of each pair is calculated.
  3. The total cost is then calculated.
            


**Code:**     
```python
def minCost(efficiency):
  # Sort the array of efficiencies in ascending order
  efficiency.sort()

  # Exclude the last element (highest efficiency) from the array
  efficiency.pop()

  # Initialize the total cost to zero
  cost = 0

  # Loop through the array in pairs
  for i in range(0, len(efficiency), 2):
    # Calculate the cost of each pair as the absolute difference of their efficiencies
    pairCost = abs(efficiency[i] - efficiency[i + 1])

    # Add the pair cost to the total cost
    cost += pairCost

  # Return the total cost
  return cost
 ```
 
 **Solution:** 
 
   The minimum cost is **503**
