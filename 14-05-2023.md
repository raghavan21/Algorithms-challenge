    Question 6: How many steps are needed to disconnect the string?

**Language:**   
                
    Python

            
**Code:**     
```python
def minimum_steps_to_delete_series(series):
    # Count the number of different characters in the series
    distinct_chars = set(series)
    num_distinct_chars = len(distinct_chars)

    # Subtract one from the count to get the minimum number of steps required to delete the entire series
    steps = num_distinct_chars - 1

    return steps + 1


print(minimum_steps_to_delete_series(
    "kjslaqpwoereeeeewwwefifjdksjdfhjdksdjfkdfdlddkjdjfjfjfjjjjfjffnefhkjgefkgjefkjgkefjekihutrieruhigtefhgbjkkkknbmssdsdsfdvneurghiueor"))  # Output: 22
   ```
 **Solution:** 
 
   The minimum number of steps required to delete the series is 22.
